### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name, as you can see is Raphael Argento. I've been a designer and animation teacher for 10 years. I have a Doctorate degree in Design and when I was researching ways of programming for motion capture I discovered this area of study and research in Computer Science called "Computer Vision". I was so excited about the new stuff I was discovering while researching and at the same time feeling so unprepared to go deep into this field - in design we don't have the math background required to comprehend how these systems work - that I decided to start a new undergrad course in Data Science. So, let's talk about what I am doing right now:

- ðŸ”­ I didn't stop my career. I am still a researcher currently working on projects at the Federal Institute of Rio de Janeiro (IFRJ). I was able to found a laboratory of research in digital design by raising funds from the Brazilian Ministry of Education. I am still a professor at this institution.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science at the Virtual University of State of SÃ£o Paulo (UNIVESP) and probably finish this course in December 2024. I am also learning Java, Github and Python. I studied the necessary math required for Computer Vision in an Engineering undergrad course I applied before I changed to DS.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with tips for people who are beginning in this field. I want to learn and grow fast with the correct foundations.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Digital Design. I have worked with 3D software for many years, including 3DS Max and Maya and I hope to learn how to mix Digital Design and Computer Vision.
- ðŸ“« You can reach through my e-mail address: raphaelargento@gmail.com or my linkedin profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphaelargento/

I hope to upgrade this Readme soon with a more deep understanding on Computer Vision.
